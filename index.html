                        As a computer science and biology student, I hope to gain skills and hands-on experience in both medicine and technology. I would also like to gain experience and exposure to different fields and industries along the way. Ultimately, I plan on working at the intersection of biomedicine and data science to improve patient outcomes with extensive and well-communicated information.

                        Outside of programming and academics, I take care of my furball Terry. I also enjoy watching dramatic TV shows, playing video games, eating too much fastfood and walking the streets of New York City.
