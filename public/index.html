                                    Plate is not just any ordinary task management application! What makes it unique is its time tracking and budgeting feature. There are 168 hours in a week. Subtracting time needed for basic human necessities like sleep, we have around 100 hours a week to be productive. Plate helps the user budget those 100 hours accordingly to the user's different responsibilities and commitments. It divvies up those hours accordingly, and makes sure the tasks tagged with those commitments do not exceed the time alloted. It holds the user accountable to their time and does not let them overwork or underwork for each commitment they've signed up for.

                                    Using open source data on NYC's demographics and the NY Times' COVID data, I created 14 tables, maps, and graphs showing different relationships between factors. One of the noteworthy findings that I found was that the negative correlation between the number of COVID cases and the zip code area's median income is significantly stronger than the negative correlation between the number of COVID cases and the population density of the zip code area. What I infer from this is that socioeconomic status has a stronger effect on COVID than people's ability to follow social distancing.

                                    In order to address the water waste issue in agriculture, the team created a network of monitoring sensors that detected soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and UV index. This information is then presented to the user (presumably farmers) in an accessible way, in both a desktop dashboard and iOS app. Both show the data and alert the user if certain measurements are beyond ideal conditions. Moreover, there is a machine learning algorithm that predicts crop yield in kg/acre based on the 4 measurements.

                                    We are preventing inaccessibility before it even arises! Using computer vision algorithms, we allow engineers and interior designers to align their designs to accessibility regulations and best practices. This improves the quality of life for every differently-abled person. <br />Our website provides a platform for engineers, architects, interior designers, and other home creators to have a checklist of accessibility regulations. Using computer vision to "check off" the different requirements for making an accessible home makes it even more convenient for creators to tailor their designs to the user that requires accommodations. Users can take a picture of a part of the house, like the door, and see if it's accessible for all users. In this example, the app will check whether the door is wide enough to fit a wheelchair.

It (1) classifies the user's image based on what kind of trash it is, (2) teach the user how to recycle that item, and (3) measure the user's impact on the environment.<br />The user takes a picture of a piece of trash and our product classifies that trash based on 14 categories. Based on that category, the user is taught how to recycle, repurpose, or dispose of that trash. Moreover, the impact of the user's actions is measured and quantified.

                                    Reunited provides a platform for families to find their missing children as well as a way for concerned citizens to report a child's information to help find their family. The web app compares two photographs of children and determines whether those two children are the same person with an accuracy of over 90%. This creates a match between parent and temporary caretakers in order to reconnect the children with their families.

                                    Captain Planet simulates an interactive underwater VR domain, aimed towards educating people of all ages about the marine ecosystem depletion due to human activities. It takes the user in a multiplayer underwater ocean bed, whilst monitoring the health levels of the surroundings. It provides them with a closer perspective on water pollution, dead zones, and instructs them on the basic steps that one can take to preserve oceans. It is a multi-level game that begins by restoring a stable ecosystem in a dead zone covered by an algal bloom. Along every step of the way, Captain Planet's immersive platform educates users on what steps need to be taken to restore a healthy environment.

                                    One of the biggest disparities in healthcare is the lack of widespread knowledge of many common health issues. We wanted to create an application that would help address this and decrease the severity of this, making room for more universal access to healthcare. Users can take a photo of themselves which will undergo facial emotion recognition. An additional questionnaire will be administered, detailing symptoms associated with health issues associated with the emotion that the user is displaying. Based on the user's answers to the questionnaire, an automated voice call will be made to the number that the user had inputted as their primary care physician, detailing the symptoms they had been experiencing and the possible health issue they could be a result of, urging a call back to the user to schedule an appointment.
